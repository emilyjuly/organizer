      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that provides low-level
        utility classes to build custom designs directly in your markup. It
        offers a modern approach to styling web applications, making it easier
        to create responsive, mobile-first designs without writing custom CSS.

      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        To get started with Tailwind CSS, you can include it in your project
        using a CDN. Here’s an example of how to set it up:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
          &lt;link
          href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tailwindcss@2.2.19/dist/tailwind.min.css"
          rel="stylesheet"&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        After including Tailwind CSS, you can start using its utility classes in
        your HTML. Here’s an example of a simple button styled with Tailwind:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
          &lt;button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold
          py-2 px-4 rounded"&gt;Button&lt;/button&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>

      <h2>Responsive Design</h2>
      <p>
        Tailwind makes it easy to create responsive designs. You can use
        responsive utility variants to apply different styles at different
        screen sizes. Here’s an example:
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-javascript">
          &lt;div class="bg-white p-6 rounded shadow md:bg-blue-500
          lg:bg-green-500"&gt; Responsive Background Color &lt;/div&gt;
        </code>
      </pre>
